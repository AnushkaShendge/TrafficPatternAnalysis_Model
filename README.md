# K-means Clustering for Traffic Pattern Analysis

## Project Overview
This project utilizes K-means clustering to analyze traffic patterns based on geographical and temporal data. The goal is to identify distinct clusters of traffic behavior using a dataset obtained from Kaggle.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
- **Dive No**: Unique identifier for each dive or data point.
- **Latitude**: Geographic coordinate of latitude.
- **Longitude**: Geographic coordinate of longitude.
- **Date and Time**: Timestamp indicating when the data point was recorded.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library used for machine learning algorithms, including K-means clustering.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Libraries used for data visualization.
